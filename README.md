# 🛒 E-commerce Return Rate Reduction Analysis

## 📋 Project Overview
This project analyzes e-commerce product returns to identify patterns and predict future returns.  
The goal is to help reduce return rates by understanding high-risk products, suppliers, and customer behavior.

Tools used:
- Python (Logistic Regression Model)
- Power BI (Interactive Dashboard with Drill-through)
- SQL (optional for deeper querying)
- Dataset: Synthetic e-commerce returns data
