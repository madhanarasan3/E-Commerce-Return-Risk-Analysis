# E-Commerce-Return-Risk-Analysis
Analyzed e-commerce return rates during my Data Analytics Internship at Elevate Labs. Cleaned datasets with Python, used logistic regression to predict product returns, and built an interactive Power BI dashboard with drill-through filters. Delivered a CSV of high-risk products and a Python codebase for predictions.
